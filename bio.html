            <p class = "text-light">Finn Petrie is an interdisciplinary artist and game developer based in Ōtepoti/Dunedin. He holds a B.Sc (Hons) First Class in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Otago, and a Masters of Visual Arts from the Dunedin School of Art. His practice 
              and technological works draw from research into post-human theory, computer science, biology, and mathematics, as well as the surrounding social relations of these fields. In this way he is concerned with ways of making with the more-than-human world, bringing closer those who are ontologically distant through the use of modern and emerging technologies. His practice then speculates on what a responsible use of technlogy might be while searching for new ways of worlding.
